# Pokemanki

By Siven Chinniah (inspired by the big throbbing brain of Xander Schmidt and the fabulous hair of Ben Gorman)

Pokemanki is an add-on that keeps you motivated to keep doing Anki by allowing you to catch and train Pokémon!  Pokemanki gives you a Pokémon (or an egg which will hatch into a Pokémon) for each lowest-level deck (deck without subdecks) in your collection that you have started learning.  As you learn and review the cards in that deck, your Pokémon will level up and may even evolve!

Your Pokemon can be accessed by viewing your Stats, where they will be above the rest of your boring charts and figures.  Here you can see either the Pokémon for the specific deck or for the whole collection by clicking "deck" or "whole collection" at the bottom of the Stats screen.  You can also hover over a Pokémon to see which deck they come from so you can train that specific Pokémon.

The settings can be accessed under "Tools".
